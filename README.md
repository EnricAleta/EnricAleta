# 👋 Hi, I’m Enric Aletà  
**MSc in Business Analytics @ ESADE**  
📍 Finance x Data Science | Investment Analyst| Python | Bloomberg

---

I'm passionate about bridging the worlds of finance and technology. After completing a degree in Economics at UPF, I pursued a Master’s in Business Analytics at ESADE to dive deep into data-driven decision making. My goal is to apply this hybrid background to roles in Private Equity, Asset Management, or Investment Banking where I can combine rigorous financial analysis with machine learning, automation, and market intelligence.

In parallel, I’ve built a portfolio of projects that reflect my analytical mindset and interest in real-world applications, ranging from predictive models in healthcare investing to portfolio tracking apps in Streamlit.
